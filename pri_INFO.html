    <h2>
      Priyanka Chopra Jonas (pronounced [prɪˈjəŋka ˈtʃoːpɽa],[1] born 18 July
      1982) is an Indian actress, model, and film producer. The winner of the
      Miss World 2000 pageant, Chopra is one of India's highest-paid and most
      popular entertainers. She has received numerous accolades, including two
      National Film Award and five Filmfare Awards. In 2016, the Government of
      India honoured her with the Padma Shri, and Time named her one of the 100
      most influential people in the world, and in the next two years, Forbes
      listed her among the World's 100 Most Powerful Women.
      <br />
      Although Chopra initially aspired to study aeronautical engineering, she
      accepted offers to join the Indian film industry, which came as a result
      of her pageant wins, making her debut with Tamil film Thamizhan (2002).
      Then she made her Bollywood debut in The Hero: Love Story of a Spy (2003).
      She played the leading lady in the box-office hits Andaaz (2003) and
      Mujhse Shaadi Karogi (2004) and received critical acclaim for her breakout
      role in the 2004 thriller Aitraaz. Chopra established herself with
      starring roles in the top-grossing productions Krrish and Don (both 2006),
      and she later reprised her role in their sequels.
