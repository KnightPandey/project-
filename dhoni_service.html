    <h2>
        MS Dhoni established his MS Dhoni Charity Foundation in 2010 and collaborated with many NGOs for serving
        different causes. <br>
        As per an article on Yourstory, MS Dhoni is among the top charitable cricketers of India. The list also has
        Kapil Dev, Yuvraj Singh and Sachin Tendulkar. <br>
        No one can forget his 2 crore donation to CRPF. <br>
        He coordinates with Virat Kohli’s charity foundation VKF to serve the needy people.
        With the Rhiti Foundation, MS Dhoni also works for a noble charity cause for uplifting young athletes. <br>
        Truly MS Dhoni really has a heart of gold, so if you’re trolling him for his donations for coronavirus, you’re
        out of context. You never knew how much he had donated so far.
