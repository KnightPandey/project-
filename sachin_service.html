    <h2>
        Tendulkar was one of the first nine celebrities appointed by the Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi to spread
        awareness regarding cleanliness and make Swachh Bharat Mission (Clean India Mission) a people's movement. <br>
        The cricketer accepted the nomination and posted a video of sweeping a street with his friends in Mumbai. <br>
        In 2017, he joined hands with Aditya Thackeray and sanitation workers to clean the Bandra Fort to contribute to
        Swachhata Hi Seva (cleanliness is service) campaign.  <br> In 2019, he was awarded the most effective Swachhta
        Ambassador by India Today Group's fifth edition of Safaigiri awards for using his popularity and fame to promote
        cleanliness and ensure the country achieves its goal of a Swachh Bharat. <br> On the occasion of the World
        Nature Conservation day 2020, the cricketer took to twitter to spread message about the preservation of
        biodiversity.
